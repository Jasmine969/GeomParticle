# GeomParticle
A Python programme for particle-based geometry construction. I use it for Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation.

Miscellaneous geometries made up of particles with a spacing of `dl`, including 2D geometries (thick rectangle, filled rectangle, thick/filled ring), 3D geometries (block, side surface of a cylinder, torus). Diverse operations are also provided, including translation, mirror, rotation, stack, and union. 

Some utility functions are also provided.
